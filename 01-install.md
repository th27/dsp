# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.3.5`.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python
ipython
ipython notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac

If you use a Mac, install Homebrew if you don't
have it yet. You could use Homebrew to manage your `git` and `python`
installs as well, but the methods given above are very good and more
cross-platform.

###Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is currently based on Python version 2.7. Students have the option of using either version 2 or 3 during the bootcamp, but should be aware of some differences in code between the two versions.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> I installed 2.7 for three reasons. I initially invested a lot of time researching / asking around for the best way to get into learning Python. Learn Python the Hard Way was recommended multiple times - I settled on this as my first step. LPTHW is taught in Python 2 and Zed Shaw makes a compelling argument to avoid Python 3. Secondly, it was pre-installed on my Mac - path of least resistance! Thirdly as I did further research on whether I would be making an irreversible decision, all commentary suggested that the transition between 2 and 3, once programming concepts were well learnt would be minimal. I have since done online courses in Python 2 and 3 and have found most of the differences entirely manageable.

###Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

How can you check the version of Python installed if you happen to be on an unfamiliar computer?

>> 1. Open a terminal windows or shell 2. Type in the following command: python --version
